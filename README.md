#Star Wars opening crawl using Three.js

This website is a quick experimentation using the THREE.js library to reproduce one of the Star Wars opening crawl in 3D in your browser.

This is a work in progress and needs some fixing to make it faster and add the rest of the text.


##TODO:

* Clean and refactor the code to make it faster.
* Add the other paragraphs.
* Maybe add some stars and music.
